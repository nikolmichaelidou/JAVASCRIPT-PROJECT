# Cheese Mines Quizâ„¢ðŸ§€

## Description

A fun online quiz meant to educate people about the cheese mines in the USA! How did they start? Why? Is it all a conspiracy? ðŸ‘€

## Planning

- First I've had to figure put who is this website for?
  - Is the topic interesting?
    - Why this topic? 
      - Cheese mines sounds more like an amusment park ride than goverment warehouses full of cheese.
      - People in the USA somewhat now what they are (or think that they are fake) but not here in here in Europe. So I thought their fun and turn into a fun quiz.
    <br>

I've drawn a small outline on how the website should like first, before start coding.

## Bugs & Fixes

- The JavaScript Quiz would not show on HTML page.
Managed to fix by retyping last part of the code in JS and fixing file arrangement.
- If the user selects the correct answer, it will still mark it as wrong.
Fixed, the bug was caused by a typo in JS.

## Unfixed Bugs

When the user get an answer right or wrong, the entire section get's highlighted not just the answer.
